Abstract
========

This is one of these tools that has to 'do it all'. Luckily, it's based on the
hard work and labour of others, where possible we rely on very solid
architecture.

This tool serves for my project needs. As such I need:

* flexible uniform methods of data access, retrieval, storage
* be able to quickly scaffold projects in many programs also outside node.js
* work in Linux or Mac OS X, possibly also Windows later

Core principles:

* DRY: thats why we find tapping into API's, web scraping so important
* best practices
* REST and evented IO structures
