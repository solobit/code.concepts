# findpkg

Finds the package descriptor file for a module.

## Overview

Node.js packages are specified by a directory containing a `package.json` descriptor file. The top-level package directory as well as the package name are frequently required by logging utilities and configuration file managers. The `findpkg` function returns an object providing this information.

## Features

The `findpkg` utility offers the following features:

1. Given a module, finds the directory containing the `package.json` file.
2. Parses the package name from the `package.json` file.
3. Provides a `resolve` method that resolves filenames against the package directory (includes special handling of filenames prefixed with a dot).
4. Provides fallback behavior if the module is not part of a package.

## Installation

Install using NPM.

    npm install findpkg

(Or add it to your dependencies.)

## API

Calling `require('findpkg')` returns a function taking a module.

```javascript
var findpkg = require('findpkg');
var pkginfo = findpkg(module);
```

*Parameters:*

- `module` - {Object} The module (i.e., `module` or `module.parent`).

*Returns:*

Returns an object having the following five components:

1. `found` - {Boolean} Set to true if a package descriptor file was found. (See API notes below.)
2. `name` - {String} The name property from the package descriptor file.
3. `pathname` - {String} The pathname of the package descriptor file.
4. `dirname` - {String} The directory name of the package descriptor file (the top-level directory of the package).
5. `resolve` - {Function} Resolves a filename against the `dirname` unless the filename is prefixed with a dot (i.e., `./` or `../`), in which case the current working directory is used.

*Errors:*

- Throws an exception if the argument is not a module or if the package descriptor file (if found) cannot be parsed.

*Note:*

If no `package.json` file is found, then the return value is populated from the  `module` parameter as follows:

- The `found` property is set to false.
- The `name` is set to the basename portion of the module's filename (without the extension).
- The `pathname` is set to the value of the module's filename.
- The `dirname` is set to the directory portion of the module's filename.
- The `resolve` function still resolves against the `dirname` (no change).
